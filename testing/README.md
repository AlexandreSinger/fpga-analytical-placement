# QuickStart

The full AP flow can be run using the `test_ap.py` script. For example:
```
test_ap.py alu4
```
This runs the full AP flow on the alu4 MCNC circuit.

In order to run this properly, you need a VTR repository on the `AlexandreSinger/vtr-verilog-to-routing:feature-analytical-placer` branch.


# get_intermediate_files.py manual
Before running the script, create `<test_suite_name>_config.txt` for the corresponding test suite under the `configs` directory. An example config file would be `~/vtr-verilog-to-routing/vtr_flow/tasks/regression_tests/vtr_reg_basic/basic_no_timing/config/config.txt`. The config file contains lists of architecture description and test files, and more. 
```sh
./get_intermediate_files.py <test_suite_name> -vtr_path ~/vtr-verilog-to-routing -output_path ./tests
```
After running the commend, the output can be found in `./test/<test_suite_name>`.

# generate_fix_io.py manual
Before running the script, append `--write_vpr_constraints constraint.xml` after `script_params_common = ` and then run get_intermediate_files.py.
```sh
./generate_fix_io.py <test_suite_name> -input_path ./tests
```
After running the script, the output can be found in `./tests/arch/circuit/common/io_constraint.xml`.

# run_ap_with_constraint.py
This script runs vpr with io constraints for a result directory such as `./tests` generated by previous script.
```sh
./run_ap_with_constraint.py <test_suite_name> -vtr_path ~/vtr-verilog-to-routing-ap -test_cases_path ./tests -chan_width 100
```
For the chan_width option, you should provide the largest required width for the arch circuit combination in tests dir. The result of the run is in `./tests/arch/circuit/common/ap_dir/run###`.

# test_ap.py
This script runs the above three scripts in sequence. There are less fined graned options, but is convenient to run everything at once. 
```sh
./test_ap.py <test_suite_name>
```
# collect_ap_hwpl.py
This script collects hwpl information and put them in a csv file named `hpwls.csv`.
```sh
./collect_ap_hwpl.py <test_suite_name>
```

# hpwl_compare.py
This script is meant to be run on google colab. Upload hpwls.csv to cloud first. 

# display_placement_iteration.py
This script display animation of placement if they are printed by vpr.
```sh
./dispaly_placement_iteration.py <path_to_vpr_stdout_log>
```
